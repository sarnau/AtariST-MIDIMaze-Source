THE MANUAL FOR MIDIMAZE EDITOR v1.1. DOWNWRITTEN BY BLADE OF TWL.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
If anyone out there knows the fileformat for MIDIMAZE II then
please contact me !!!


                              WARNING !!!

     Do never start up MIDIMAZE before all in the midi-ring have
     switched on their computers !!!

     If you do so, a high voltage signal (I hope you understand
     what I mean, even if my english isn't the best) might go
     through the midi-ring and hit your computer.
     If MIDIMAZE is loaded and waiting for connection, the
     midiport will be "open" and the signal can without any
     problem go right into your computer with the result
     of destroying it !!!

     I heard about a copyparty where they had destroyed five
     computers in this way, so please be careful !!!

     But don't let this stop you from playing MIDIMAZE. Just make
     sure that all computers in the ring have booted up before
     anyone of you load MIDIMAZE.


     PART 1 - GENERAL INFORMATION
     ----------------------------

PUBLIC DOMAIN

     This program is public domain and you might do anything you
     like to it (including throwing the disk into the wall or
     spread it). However, I would like you to always keep it in a
     folder together with this manual and the mazes listed
     bellow, so the next person you spread it to won't be missing
     any files.

     MAZES THAT SHOULD BE KEPT TOGETHER WITH THIS PROGRAM:

     BIG_HELL, MERLIN 1-3, NILSES, ORDINARY, PACMAN, PERFEKT,
     ROOMER, ROOMS, SLAKTAR, SMIDIG, SSSS, TWILIGHT, UURRRKKK

     The MIDIMAZE EDITOR v1.1 was released the 25th of February 1992.

WHAT'S THIS PROGRAM ABOUT?

     Well it's a program that lets you write your own or edit any
     existing mazes for the great multiplayer game MIDIMAZE.
     If you don't know what MIDIMAZE is, then recieve a copy,
     gather a couple of friends, connect your computers (with
     midi cables) and play it all night long!

NEW FEATURES FOR VERSION 1.1

     * Tos 1.62 compatible.

     * You will get the right resolution and background colours 
       when quitting.

     * This manual.

     * A small bug (That you anyway probably wouldn't notice) has 
       been removed.

     * The fileselector "dir-routine" has been rewritten and now 
       works a lot better than before.

KNOWN BUGGS

     * THE MIDIMAZE EDITOR still doesn't work on Tos 2.0 or 
       higher. I'm sorry about this, but the reason is that I 
       wrote this program in STOS. That's because I began this 
       program in the autumn of -90 and back then I wasn't so 
       good in assembler and couldn't handle GFA.

     * The files made or modified in THE MIDIMAZE EDITOR doesn't 
       end up quite right, but neither MIDIMAZE nor the editor 
       find's any difference. Only if you look at the files in a 
       wordprocessor you will see that some wall segments are 
       missing. But MIDIMAZE doesn't notice that, since it only 
       uses every second wall segment (Don't mind if you didn't 
       understand that, I didn't expect you to do it).

     * The fileselector thinks a file of 0 bytes length is a 
       folder. The 'DIR' function too.

     * If a folder has the extension .MAZ then it's put out two 
       times in the fileselector.

FORTHCOMING FEATURES

       If demand is high enough (I get a few donations or letters
       telling me to do it) I will probably make a new editor for
       MIDIMAZE II in GFA or ASSEMBLER, which will assure that it
       works on ALL ST's STE's and TT's.


     PART 2 - DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ALL THE FUNCTIONS
     --------------------------------------------------

SOME GENERAL INFORMATION:

     The screen is divided into four parts boxes of various sizes.
     The biggest box (the grey one) is the actual edit box, where 
     you will be able to edit the mazes. The upper right hand box 
     is just saying "TWILIGHT - MIDIMAZE EDITOR v 1.1" and has no 
     function at all. The left bottom box is the fileselector 
     which contains a listing of all mazes and some necessary 
     functions. The last box is a menu where you make all your 
     choices.


     2.1 - THE MENU
     --------------

QUIT

     I guess this is pretty selfexplaining. After you have 
     pressed the left mousekey in this box, you will have to 
     confirm that you will quit by pressing the right button.

TWL

     Click in this box to get my adress.

THE TWO COLOUR BUTTONS

     Click in these boxes to change the colors in the edit box or 
     in the rest of the screen.

MAZE-EDITOR

     Clicking here will result in giving you the info about this 
     great program.

THE BRITISH OR SWEDISH FLAG

     Click here to change the language all messages will be 
     printed in. You can choose between English and Swedish.

NEW MAZE

     Click here to begin editing a new maze.
     You will then be prompted to enter the size of your new 
     maze. If you just press return or enter 0 the operation will 
     be canceled and you will get back to your old maze.

50HZ/60HZ

     Click here to change the syncrate of your screen.

DEBUG MAZE

     If you have made some old mazes in a wordprocessor you are 
     very likely to at least once have made a maze which MIDIMAZE 
     tells is "BOO-BOO". Just load the old maze into my editor, 
     click in this box and the maze will almost certainly be 
     corrected.

"#" (GRID ON/OFF)

     When you edit a maze, you maybe sometimes wants to get rid 
     of the white "help-lines" so you get a clearer overview of 
     the maze. Thats exactly this buttons purpose.
     Click again to show the lines.

LOAD

     Pressing this button will load the maze that currently is in 
     the middle of the fileselector (between the two pointers).
     The effect of the other button marked "LOAD" is exactly the 
     same. It's just a bit closer to the directory.

SAVE

     Saves your maze under the filename presented on the dotted 
     line below. 

DEL

     Press here to delete the maze that is positioned in the 
     middle of the fileselector (between the two pointers).

DIR

     Press here to get a directory of the files in the current 
     directory. The files are NOT sorted in alphabetic order, 
     they are just dumped in the order they were put on the disk.

SIZE

     The numbers below just tells you the size of the maze you 
     currently are editing. THE MIDIMAZE EDITOR doesn't display 
     the size in the same format as the file. THE MIDIMAZE EDITOR 
     simply tells you how many segments wide the maze is.

MAZENAME

     Filename for the maze you are editing. Press the left button 
     on the name to change it. You must give the maze a name and 
     you can't enter an empty line or the figures that the 
     standard fileselector can't take.


     2.2 - THE EDIT BOX
     ------------------

     The edit box is very easy to use. Just press the left button 
     to put up a wall and press the right button to remove a wall.
     Walls can only be placed on the shown grid.


     2.3 - THE FILESELECTOR
     ----------------------

     In the bottom left corner of the screen you can see a black 
     box with lightblue text. In the top of this box there stands 
     the path you currently are in. Below this you can see a line 
     running from the left to the right side. This marks the top 
     of the list. Below this there is either text or another line 
     that marks the bottom of the list if you haven't got any 
     folders or mazes on the disk. The text you eventually see is 
     the mazes and folders in the current directory. Folders are 
     marked with a "#" before the name and all the folders are 
     put in the beginning of the list, but they are not sorted in 
     alphabetic order. The mazes are though sorted in alphabetic
     order. The maze or folder in the middle of the fileselector 
     is the one that will be affected by LOAD, SAVE and DELETE.

UP AND DOWN ARROWS

     Press one of these buttons to scroll the filelist in the 
     desired direction. If you press the right mousekey, the 
     list will scroll faster.

OPEN

     Press here to open the folder that is placed between the two
     pointers in the middle of the box.

CLOSE

     Press here to close a folder. Press the right mousekey to
     close all folders.

LOAD

     Loads the maze placed between the pointers in the middle of
     the box. Exactly the same effect that is given by the other
     key marked "LOAD".

A

     Press here to access disk A. If disk A already is inserted,
     all folders will be closed.

B

     Press here to access disk B. If disk B already is inserted
     or if you only have one diskdrive, all folders will be closed.

DISCSPACE

     On the line beneath this text, you can see how many bytes of
     free discspace you have left.

     PART 3 - ADVICE FOR MAZEMAKERS
     ------------------------------

FIRST RULE OF MAZEDESIGNING

     The only very important rule you have to remember is:

     NEVER DIVIDE A ROOM INTO SECTIONS THAT HAVE NO CONNECTION
     AT ALL WITH EACH OTHER!

     If you do so, you will soon find yourself being placed in a
     room where you have no opponent to fight. The only exception
     to this rule is a one by one room, which MIDIMAZE will find
     too small to put you in.

KEEP IT SMALL

     Otherwise there are no rules, but I would advice you to make
     small mazes, since it's much more fun playing in a small
     (but not TOO small) maze of two reasons. You will more often
     run into an opponent and the game will run faster. Those who
     have been trying to find an enemy in a complex maze that
     really scrolled jerkily knows what I mean. I think that 8-12
     are the best sizes.

EMPTY AREAS

     If you have an empty area you don't want people to enter or
     get trapped in, simply fill the area with walls. MIDIMAZE is
     actually checking so that a person don't get trapped in a
     one by one (but not a one by two or bigger!) room before
     positioning him out.


     PART 4 - HOW A MAZEFILE IS BUILT UP.
     ------------------------------------

     The fileformat for mazes was designed so that you easily 
     should be able to edit them or design new ones in an usual
     texteditor. If you load a maze into a texteditor, you will 
     see that it is built up of the ASCII characters "X" and "." .
     a typical small maze could look like this.

     08
     XXXXXXXXX
     X.......X
     X.XXX...X
     X.X.X...X
     X.XXX.X.X
     X.....X.X
     X...XXX.X
     X.......X
     XXXXXXXXX

     The figures at the top of the maze tells the number of
     columns and lines -1 (divide by two to get the size I use in
     the editor).

     So, that seemed simple and there wouldn't be need for an
     editor. Well, if you design a maze on your own, you would
     almost certainly get a "MAZEFILE BOO-BOO" (or something like
     that) error. And if you although decided to play that maze,
     you would find that it didn't look quite right.
     
     There is a perfectly logical reason for this. It's a bit
     hard to explain, but I will give it a try.

     In a texteditor you put out 8 X 8 pixels characters, but the
     walls in MIDIMAZE are only one pixel wide!
     HYBRID ARTS have solved this by letting every second column
     represent a vertical wall and letting every second line
     represent a horizontal wall.
     I hope an example should make things clearer.

 HOW YOU SEE IT IN A TEXTEDITOR    HOW MIDIMAZE THINKS OF IT
 ------------------------------    -------------------------

          XXXXXXXXX                          - - - -
          X.......X                         |       |
          X.XXX...X                            -
          X.X.X...X                         | | |   |
          X.XXX.X.X                            -
          X.....X.X                         |     | |
          X...XXX.X                              -
          X.......X                         |       |
          XXXXXXXXX                          - - - -

     I hope you can see what I mean.
     Notice that only every second column in a line has any
     meaning. Even columns on odd lines and odd columns on even
     lines.
     If you have made a maze that didn't look right in MIDIMAZE,
     you have probably made the fault of placing a horizontal
     wall on an even column, so that every second "X" was
     converted into a vertical wall (or the other way around if
     you placed a vertical wall on an odd column).

HIDDEN ROOMS

     If you make a hole in the border of the maze (on the right
     line and column!), you get an additional room outside the
     map, where you can hide from beeing seen on the map (your
     enemies (and friends) can see you when they are dead).
     This is actually a bug in MIDIMAZE, but I thought that I
     should mention it anyway since it's a funny effect.


PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED ME WITH THIS EDITOR

Merlin of TWL    -     Thanks for telling me that the MAZ-files
     were in ASCII format, I would never have gotten the idea
     to load a MAZ-File into a wordprocessor or show it from
     the desktop!
     Also thanks for all the bug testing and all nice mazes you
     have designed.

Phantom of TWL   -     Thanks for putting me on the right trail
     when I didn't understand why my mazes didn't look the same
     in the wordprocessor as in MIDIMAZE. You only found half the
     truth, but you put me on the right trail.

The Entire TWL crew - (Phantom, Merlin, Stormlord, Dr Falken,
     Huey, Joshua, Crom and Lightman) for all your support and
     all the nice MIDIMAZE competitions (How many nights haven't
     we been nailed to our computers playing MIDIMAZE...)
