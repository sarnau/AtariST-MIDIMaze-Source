Hi Target!

This is a short docu for version 1.1.

Coping of the program is allowed as long as no profit is made.
Selling it as part of PD-Disk or CDs is NOT ALLOWED without
my written permission!!!

I would like to get some (friendly) comments about this program.
My emailadresse is bjoern.spruck@physik.uni-giessen.de

 Features
----------
- could load, view, edit and save all MAZ, MZE and DMZ-files
- drawing lines and filled rectangles
- copy, cut and paste blocks
- create random mazes (with userdefined percent values)
- browse directories
- get author and mazeinfo from DMZ files
- change mazeinfo und author
- ƒ÷‹‰ˆ¸ﬂ conversion PC-Atari and back
- printing of alls mazes in one directory with mazeinfo, author, size, ...
- browser and editor are using differnt buffers, so browsing wont destroy
  the edited maze

Every Midimaze 2 version can read the saved MZE files.
The newest (patched) Midimaze 2 can read MAZ and DMZ files, too.

Ther are some differences to the Atari version of the editor, for
example the Atari Version features drag&drop ;-)

 ToDo
------

- better browser
- browser features only short filenames (Fsfirst/Fsnext)
- Undo
- question user if maze had changed
- converting other characters besides ƒ÷‹‰ˆ¸ﬂ

 Using the editor
------------------

The handling of the editor is a bit differnt form the Atari version.

If you wanna draw some walls, you have first to select
one of the toolwindoww icons. After that, you can draw lines or
filled rectangles of the selected type.
You have to press the left mousebutton and then move the mouse
while holding the button down. Releasing the button will draw the
line/rectangle. If you press the right mousebutton before releasing
the left one, the line/rectangle will not be drawn.
You can delete lines and rectangles with the right mousebutton.
The block operations works the same way:
Click copy, select block, release mousebutton. If you press shift
while releasing the button, the block will be cut.
Now paste will be selected automatically.
The block will now be glued to the mousepointer.
Click in the mazewindow to paste the block.
Cancel by pressing the right mousebutton.

Doubleclick the mazewindow to redraw it.

Some more Shortcuts:
Toolselect with Ctrl 2-6 (Wall,Glass,Door,Copy,Paste)
and Ctrl-C Copy, Ctrl-V Paste


You can get mazes, the Win9x/NT version of this editor and new
releases of the patched Midimaze 2 version from
