Hi Target!

This is a short docu for version 1.2.

Coping of the program is allowed as long as no profit is made.
Selling it as part of PD-Disk or CDs is NOT ALLOWED without
my written permission!!!

I would like to get some (friendly) comments about this program.
My emailadresse is bjoern.spruck@physik.uni-giessen.de

 Features
----------

- could load, view, edit and save all MAZ, MZE and DMZ-files
- drawing lines and filled rectangles
- copy, cut and paste blocks
- create random mazes (with userdefined percent values)
- browse directories
- get author and mazeinfo from DMZ files
- change mazeinfo und author
- menushortcuts
- AV protocol, drag&drop, commandline


Every Midimaze 2 version can read the saved MZE files.
The newest (patched) Midimaze 2 can read MAZ and DMZ files, too.


The Win version of this editor has some more funktions than the
Atari version. For example it can print mazes and the browser
is much better.
But only the Atari version features drag&drop ;-)


 ToDo
------

- better browser
- browser features only short filenames (Fsfirst/Fsnext)
- Undo
- question user if maze had changed


 Using the editor
------------------

The handling of the editor is a bit differnt form the win version.

If you wanna draw or delete some walls, you have first to select
one of the toolwindoww icons. After that, you can draw lines or
filled rectangles of the selected type.
You have to press the left mousebutton and then move the mouse
while holding the button down. Releasing the button will draw the
line/rectangle. If you press the right mousebutton before releasing
the left one, the line/rectangle will not be drawn.
The block operations works the same way:
Click copy, select block, release mousebutton. If you press shift
while releasing the button, the block will be cut.
Now paste will be selected automatically.
Now click in the mazewindow and hold down the mousebutton to move
the block. If you release the button, the block will be pasted.
Cancel by pressing the right mousebutton.

Doubleclick the mazewindow to redraw it.

Some more Shortcuts:
Toolselect with Ctrl 1-6 (Empty,Wall,Glass,Door,Copy,Paste)
and Ctrl-C Copy, Ctrl-V Paste

The toolwindow can be used in background, if you press and hold
the right mousbutton before you click it with the left button.
If you use it this way you dont need to top the mazewindow afterwards.

The browser:
CursorUp/CursorDown load previous/next maze.
ScrollArrowUp/ScrollArrowDown scroll one entry up/down.
If you are using a multitasking AES, you better use drag&drop from
the desktops window, because in this way you wont get problems with
long filenames.


 Thanks to...

  me a lot implementing the AV-protocol and drag&drop.
- Thomas Binder, the author of Thing, who had give me hints about
  drag&drop and the "new" AES functions.



You can get mazes, the Win9x/NT version of this editor and new
