MIDI MAZE

Packed a bit by The Alien...

When it's finished loading, Midi Maze will display a box saying "This is a
SLAVE machine."- the game is designed to run on a network of STs with loads
of different people acting on their own or in teams. To link the STs with
each other, use standard MIDI leads available from your local electronics
shop. If they're any good they'll know exactly what you want as soon as you
mention "ST"!

With the STs linked together, press ALTERNATE and R on one machine to get
the link together. One machine will be a controller, the rest slaves.

To play the game in SOLO mode; you against the computer; press ALTERNATE
and S to swap to single player mode.

It's more fun against humans!

ALTERNATE and J or M for Joystick or Mouse control, during game ESC pauses
and gives you the option to quit. SPACE displays a map.

The Load... option in the menu is to load a new map- any .MAZ file.

Enjoy!
